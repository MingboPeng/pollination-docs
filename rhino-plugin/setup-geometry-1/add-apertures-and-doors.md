# Add Apertures and Doors

## Add Apertures

An aperture is any opening, hole, or gap with in a room. Apertures should always be modeled as planar surfaces that are coplanar with the appropriate face of your room. If you have floor to ceiling windows on a face of a room, then the window edge should not overlap with any room face edge.&#x20;

Similar to apertures, doors must be modeled as planar surfaces that are coplanar with the appropriate face of your room.&#x20;
