# Add Rooms

## What are Rooms and Why Do You Need Them?&#x20;

Pollination uses a room-based modeling hierarchy which allows for surface-based modifications. The room-by-room approach is efficient for creating a quick analytical model to simulate energy, daylight, or comfort performance without spending time with a surface-by-surface.&#x20;

There are two methods for creating rooms using Pollination, you can add rooms from the geometry or from layers.&#x20;

_Note: a room-based model is not required for daylight simulations, users can still use surface-by-surface method to build a daylight model. It is worth noting that a non-room-based model is not simulate-able for EnergyPlus simulations._

_Note: all rooms should be modeled as a closed planar polysurface. If they are not, then you will see an error indicating that your polysurface is open.  _
