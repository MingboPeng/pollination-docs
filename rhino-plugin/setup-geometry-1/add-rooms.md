# Add Rooms

## What are Rooms and Why Do You Need Them? 

Pollination uses a room-based modeling hierarchy which allows for surface-based modifications. The room-by-room approach is efficient for creating a quick analytical model to simulate energy, daylight, or comfort performance without spending time with a surface-by-surface. 

There are two methods for creating rooms using Pollination, you can add rooms from the geometry or from layers.

## Modeling Best Practices

All rooms should be modeled as a closed planar polysurface. If they are not, then you will see an error indicating that your polysurface is open.
