# Download and Install the Rhino Plugin

## Download

During early access, download of the Rhino plugin is currently restricted. We will update this section to coincide with the release of the Rhino plugin.

## Installation

### Step 1

Run the .exe file to start the installation. The installer can also be used to remove components, update Pollination, or uninstall previous versions of Pollination. If you already have a version of Pollination installed then the installer will automatically show these options.   

{% hint style="danger" %}
Rhino must be closed before running the installer to install or uninstall Pollination
{% endhint %}
