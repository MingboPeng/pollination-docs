# Rhino User Interface

## Pollination Rhino Panel

Get started with Pollination in Rhino by typing [`PO_ModelPanel`](pollination-commands-for-rhino/po_modelpanel.md) in the command line. Once you hit Enter, the Pollination panel will emerge. You can dock it in your window as you would a native Rhino panel.
