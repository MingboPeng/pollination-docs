Command [PO\_AddSensorGrid ](../pollination-commands-for-rhino/po_addsensorgrid.md)works for any type of Rhino geometries, it converts input geometries to sensor grids based on users grid settings: grid size, and grid offset. This command also understands room type, and only select surfaces with floor type within this room and convert them to sensor grids.
