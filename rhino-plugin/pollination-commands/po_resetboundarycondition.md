# PO\_ResetBoundaryCondition

Reset a room to reset all child faces' boundary condition. You can also select partial room's sub-faces for resetting boundary condition. All geometries' boundary condition will be reset to Outdoor, unless geometry touches the ground \(0\) and then it will be set to Ground.
