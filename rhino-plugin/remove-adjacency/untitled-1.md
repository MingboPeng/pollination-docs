Import a new program type from OpenStudio Standards template.

Note: [OpenStudio Standards](https://github.com/NREL/openstudio-standards/) are developed by the US. [National Renewable Energy Laboratory](https://www.nrel.gov/) \(NREL\)'s OpenStudio Team. It includes ASHRAE 90.1 baseline model's program types and HVAC system templates. We convert them to [Honeybee Schema](https://www.ladybug.tools/honeybee-schema/model.html) standard format so it becomes one of the trusted data sources that we can use across our entire eco-system.
