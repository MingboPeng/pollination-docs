NOTE: We use [Paddle](https://paddle.com) to process all payments on our platform. Once you complete payment, you will receive an email from Ladybug Tools (via Paddle.com) with a link to your invoice/receipt. Please check your spam and junk folders after making your payment if you don't see an email confirmation in your inbox.&#x20;

A full history of paid and upcoming transactions is also available under the _Payments_ tab on the _Subscription_ page.&#x20;

### **Manage floating licenses**

All the Pollination Rhino licenses are floating licenses. That means that you can share them with other users on Pollination.

Click on the `Manage Floating Licenses` button under the subscription tab.&#x20;

There are two other tabs under the _Rhino Plugin Subscription_ panel.

### **Manage tab**

You can use the _manage_ tab to manage your subscription. In particular, you can:

1. Add more licenses to your current subscription. _Note that updating the subscription will remove all your current coupons._
2. Cancel your subscription. _Note that we have a no refund policy. If you want to cancel your subscription for the next upcoming payment you should cancel it right before the new payment kicks in._
3. Update your payment method
