# Upgrade to Professional

A professional account is a single-user account that supports private projects, more cloud computing resources, and more storage. For the details, you can check out our [pricing page](https://www.pollination.cloud/pricing).

### Step 1

To upgrade to a Professional account, you can click on the "Subscription" tab or click on your avatar to find the "Subscription" option. Here you will find a button to upgrade your account to a Professional subscription. &#x20;
