### **Manage Floating Licenses**

All the Pollination Rhino licenses are floating licenses. That means that you can share them with other users on Pollination.

Click on the `Manage Floating Licenses` button under the subscription tab.&#x20;

### **Manage tab**

You can use the _manage_ tab to manage your subscription. In particular, you can:

1. Add more licenses to your current subscription. _Note that updating the subscription will remove all your current coupons._
2. Cancel your subscription. _Note that we have a no refund policy. If you want to cancel your subscription for the next upcoming payment you should cancel it right before the new payment kicks in._
3. Update your payment method
