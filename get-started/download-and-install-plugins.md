# Download and Install Plugins

Pollination plugins are required if you would like to use Pollination from within your CAD/BIM software.

For plugin pricing, please visit our [pricing page](https://www.pollination.cloud/pricing-cad-plugins).  Click on one of the tabs below that correspond with your software to get started.&#x20;

## Download

During public BETA access, download of the Rhino plugin is available through our Discourse site only. You can use your Pollination account credentials to log on to Discourse. The download link is located at the end of the [Pollination's Rhino plugin (WIP) is now available for download!](https://discourse.pollination.cloud/t/pollinations-rhino-plugin-wip-is-now-available-for-download/558?u=jankivyas) post.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The Pollination Rhino plugin is designed for optimal compatibility with Rhino 7. If you are using Rhino 6, there is an incompatibility issue with the way Rhino 6 loads plugins. After installing Pollination, you will need to open and close Rhino **three times** to load the Pollination plugin.

1. Go to C:\Users\\\[USERNAME]\ladybug\_tools\resources\standards\\
2. Copy the "honeybee\_standards" folder to another location before running the installer
3. Once the installer is executed, you can copy "honeybee\_standards" folder back to the original location.
