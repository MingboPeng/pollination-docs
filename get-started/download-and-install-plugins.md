# Plugin Installation

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Rhino" %}
{% hint style="info" %}
The Pollination Rhino plugin is designed for optimal compatibility with Rhino 7. If you are using Rhino 6, there is an incompatibility issue with the way Rhino 6 loads plugins. After installing Pollination, you will need to open and close Rhino **three times** to load the Pollination plugin.
{% endhint %}



### Step 1

{% hint style="warning" %}
Rhino must be closed before running the installer to install or uninstall Pollination.
{% endhint %}

Double-click on the "PollinationRHGHPluginInstaller-latest.exe" file to start the installation. The installer can also be used to remove components, update Pollination, or uninstall previous versions of Pollination. If you already have a version of Pollination installed then the installer will automatically show these options.

{% hint style="info" %}
The installer also updates Ladybug Tools for Grasshopper. So if are an existing user of Ladybug Tools and have custom libraries for Honeybee that you'd like to maintain, please use the following process to backup your files.

1. Go to C:\Users\\\[USERNAME]\ladybug\_tools\resources\standards\\
2. Copy the "honeybee\_standards" folder to another location before running the installer
3. Once the installer is executed, you can copy "honeybee\_standards" folder back to the original location.
