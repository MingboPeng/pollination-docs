# Create an Organization

An organization account is the only account type that supports multiple users and the ability to create teams. An organization can be a company, an association, a joint venture, or any other entity.

### Step 1

Click on your avatar and select _Subscription_ to bring up your subscription management page. Click on _New Organization (_blue button) to create a new Organization.&#x20;

### Step 2

Type in the account email address, display name, and a unique name for your account. As the name implies, Pollination supports duplicate display names, but unique names must be - unique! If the name you chose is already taken, the entry field will alert you to choose a different name. Additionally, instead of uploading an Organization avatar as an image, we require a URL address to an image. Click on _Create Organization_ to continue.

### Step 3

Once you've created an organization, you can select the number of seats you'd like to purchase and add members to your organization. Use the search for members field to search for eligible members with Pollination accounts. Then click Purchase seats to finalize your purchase.
