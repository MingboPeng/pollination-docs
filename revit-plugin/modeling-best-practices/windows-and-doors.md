## Non-rectilinear Windows

When creating non-rectilinear windows, use the correct family type to ensure a clean analytical model. In the example below, you can see how family type affects the translated analytical model. When curtain wall is used to model a circular window, the analytical model has many more surfaces and the glazed areas are fragmented and misaligned. When a window family is used, the translated model is clean and requires no rework.
