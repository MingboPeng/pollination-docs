# Rooms

## Settings

Avoid room export errors by selecting the "Areas and Volumes" room computation option. While this option might be slower than the areas only option, it generates rooms that are bounded more accurately in height.

## Room Bounding Elements

Ensure all appropriate elements are room bounding, this includes: 

* Walls
* Curtain Walls
* Floors
* Ceilings
* Roofs

If room bounding is not selected in the properties tab, it will not export correctly.
