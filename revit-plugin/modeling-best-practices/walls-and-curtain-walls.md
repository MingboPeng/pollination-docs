# Walls and Curtain Walls

## Walls



## Compound Walls

On many projects, there are instances where compound walls are required. For example, a project may have a concrete curb at the base or there is a shorter furred wall over masonry. To properly export a model from Revit for analysis, Pollination requires dissimilar wall types to be a compound wall instead of multiple walls drawn in parallel or stacked on top of each other. This not only makes it easier to model doors and windows for architectural purposes, but it also facilitates a seamless model export. 

### Stacked Wall 

In wall properties, select the option to create a Stacked Wall family for instances where you have a stone, concrete, or other material at the base of the wall.

You can stack multiple wall types in section while maintaining a single wall definition for simulation and analysis. The wall types will render in section view from the top down.

### Basic Wall with Baseboard, Wainscoting, or Other Details

Use the sweeps, reveals, merge, and split options \(only visible when section preview is selected in the view\) to add baseboards and other custom wall details. DO NOT model multiple walls in parallel.
