# Download and Install the Revit Plugin

## Download

During public BETA access, download of the Revit plugin is available through our Discourse site only. If you don't have a Discourse account, you can sign up [here](https://discourse.pollination.cloud/).

{% hint style="danger" %}
The Pollination plugin currently supports Revit 2022 - 2019. If you are using an older version of Revit, you will need to upgrade to more recent Revit release to use Pollination. 

Additionally, this is a Work In Progress \(WIP\) release. It may crash Revit, so please be patient with us and make sure to save your files frequently! 

Please share instances that cause a crash, so we can improve the plugin. Thanks!
